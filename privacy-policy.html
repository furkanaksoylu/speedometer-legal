  <h2>1) Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the App processes information when you use features like real-time speed display,
    HUD mode, trip recording, trip history, driving statistics, speed alerts, and exporting trip data.
  </p>
  <p>
    The App is designed to minimize data collection. Where possible, your trip and driving data is stored on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>2) What data the App processes</h2>

  <h3>A. Location data (GPS)</h3>
  <p>
    If you allow location access, the App processes <strong>precise location data</strong> to calculate speed, distance,
    route/trip information, and related statistics.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Real-time speedometer, HUD mode, trip recording, trip summaries (avg/max speed, distance, duration), speed alerts.</li>
    <li><strong>Required?</strong> Yes for speed/trip features. Without location permission, the App cannot measure GPS speed accurately.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>B. Trip and driving data you create</h3>
  <p>
    When you record trips, the App may store driving-related data such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Trip start/end time and duration</li>
    <li>Distance traveled</li>
    <li>Average and maximum speed</li>
    <li>Optional route points (if your trip recording includes a path/track)</li>
    <li>Alert settings (tolerance, repeat mode, alert types)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Storage:</strong> By default, this data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> (unless you enable a cloud sync feature, if offered).
  </p>

  <h3>C. Exported files (CSV / JSON / KML)</h3>
  <p>
    If you use export features, the App generates files (e.g., CSV/JSON/KML) that can include trip data and, if applicable,
    route points. You control where you save/share those files using iOS sharing options.
  </p>

  <h3>D. Purchases (Pro features)</h3>
  <p>
    If you purchase Pro features, Apple processes payment information. The App receives purchase status information
    (e.g., whether Pro is active) to unlock features.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>We do not receive</strong> your full payment details (such as card number).</li>
    <li><strong>We may process</strong> purchase identifiers or receipts needed to validate Pro access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>E. Diagnostics (optional)</h3>
  <p>
    The App may process limited technical information to improve stability (e.g., crash logs). This may include device model,
    OS version, app version, and error events. It should not include your trip content unless you choose to share it.
  </p>

  <!-- OPTIONAL: Analytics Section -->
  <!-- Delete this entire section if you do NOT use analytics/telemetry -->
  <h3>F. Analytics (optional)</h3>
  <p>
    If enabled, analytics help us understand which features are used (e.g., HUD mode, trip history, speed alerts) and
    improve the App. Analytics typically include app events and device-related metadata, and are not intended to directly
    identify you.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Legal bases (GDPR)</h2>
  <p>We process personal data under the following legal bases where applicable:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a)):</strong> For precise location access and any optional analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Contract (Art. 6(1)(b)):</strong> To provide Pro features you purchased and core app functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)):</strong> For basic diagnostics and preventing abuse, where applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) How long we keep data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On-device trip data:</strong> Stored until you delete it in the App or remove the App from your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Exported files:</strong> Stored wherever you save them; you control deletion.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics/analytics (if used):</strong> Retained only as long as necessary for troubleshooting and improving the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Sharing and disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data. We share data only in the following cases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple / App Store services:</strong> For in-app purchases and app distribution.</li>
    <li><strong>Service providers (optional):</strong> If we use crash reporting or analytics providers, they may process technical events on our behalf.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> If required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- OPTIONAL: Cloud Sync Section -->
  <!-- Delete if you do NOT have any servers/cloud sync -->
  <h2>6) Cloud / server processing (only if applicable)</h2>
  <p>
    If the App offers cloud sync or server-backed storage in the future, this policy will be updated to describe what is stored,
    where, and for how long. Unless explicitly stated in-app, trip data remains on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>7) Your rights (EEA/UK)</h2>
  <p>
    If GDPR applies, you may have the right to request access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability, and to object
    to certain processing. You can also withdraw consent at any time (for example, by turning off location permission in iOS).
  </p>
  <p>
    To exercise rights, contact us using the details above. You may also lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
  </p>

  <h2>8) Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable safeguards to protect information. However, no method of storage is 100% secure.
    You are responsible for protecting your device and exported files.
  </p>

  <h2>9) Children</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country). We do not knowingly collect
    personal data from children.
  </p>

  <h2>10) International transfers</h2>
  <p>
    If analytics/crash providers are used, data may be processed in countries outside your country of residence.
    Where required, we rely on appropriate transfer mechanisms (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses).
  </p>

  <h2>11) Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the effective date above and, where appropriate,
    provide notice within the App.
