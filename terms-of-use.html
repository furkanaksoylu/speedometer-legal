  <p>
    We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial use
    on Apple-branded devices you own or control, subject to Apple’s App Store terms and these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Restrictions</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Copy, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code except where allowed by law.</li>
    <li>Use the App for unlawful purposes, or in a way that violates traffic laws or safety rules.</li>
    <li>Remove or alter any proprietary notices.</li>
    <li>Distribute, sell, rent, lease, or sublicense the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Safety disclaimer (important)</h2>
  <p>
    The App uses GPS and device sensors and may be inaccurate, delayed, or unavailable depending on signal, device, environment,
    and other factors. The App is provided for informational purposes only.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Always follow road signs and traffic laws.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Do not interact with the App while driving.</strong> Configure settings before driving or ask a passenger to operate the device.</li>
    <li>We are not responsible for tickets, accidents, injuries, or damages resulting from use of the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Pro features and purchases</h2>
  <p>
    The App may offer paid “Pro” features (for example: trip recording, trip history, advanced stats, speed alerts, custom alerts,
    exporting trip data). Purchases are processed by Apple through In-App Purchase.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prices and availability are shown in the App and may change.</li>
    <li>Refunds and cancellations are handled according to Apple’s policies.</li>
    <li>If Pro access is time-based (subscription), it may auto-renew unless canceled in your Apple ID settings.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>6) User content and exported data</h2>
  <p>
    Trips, routes, and exported files you generate are your responsibility. If you share exported CSV/JSON/KML files,
    you understand they may contain sensitive information such as locations and times.
  </p>

  <h2>7) Updates and changes</h2>
  <p>
    We may update the App to improve performance, fix bugs, or change features. Some features may require newer iOS versions.
    We may also modify or discontinue parts of the App at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>8) Availability</h2>
  <p>
    We do not guarantee that the App will be available at all times or that it will operate without errors.
    GPS speed and trip recording depend on factors outside our control.
  </p>

  <h2>9) Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind,
    including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
  </p>

  <h2>10) Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive
    damages, or any loss of data, profits, or business, arising out of or related to your use of the App.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where liability cannot be excluded, it is limited to the amount you paid for the App or Pro features (if any) in the
    12 months prior to the claim, unless mandatory law requires otherwise.
  </p>

  <h2>11) Termination</h2>
  <p>
    This license remains effective until terminated. We may terminate it if you violate these Terms.
    Upon termination, you must stop using the App and delete it from your devices.
  </p>

  <h2>12) Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Your use of the App is also governed by the Privacy Policy. Please review it to understand how location and trip data may be processed.
  </p>

  <h2>13) Governing law</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms are governed by the laws of Germany, excluding conflict-of-law rules. If you are a consumer in the EEA/UK,
    you may also benefit from mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence.
